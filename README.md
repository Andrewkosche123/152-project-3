This command to run after you enter the project directory
java org.antlr.v4.Tool Main.g4

each will create their own parse three

### Notes on hierachey
* `gen` directory contains all of the ANTLR generated files. These are left as is and without modification.
* `src` directory contains all of the code written by us including the driver and the custom Listeners and Visitors
  * These custom listeners and visitors extend the generated 
* `RailRoad` directory contains an HTML file along with stylesheet for all of the RailRoad diagrams.
